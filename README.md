EVEMap
======

An EVE Online starmap screensaver using Java and JMonkeyEngine.

Deploy to Windows by building the project using the JMonkeyEngine IDE (I'm unsure how you'd open the project in Eclipse, Netbeans or etc., but the JME IDE is NetBeans so it should be possible). the EVEMap/dist directory will contain a "MyGame-windows.zip" archive. After extracting this archive into some directory, copy the EVEMap/assets into the same directory. Rename the .exe to a .scr to use it as a screensaver, then right click -> "install" to install it as a Windows screensaver.
